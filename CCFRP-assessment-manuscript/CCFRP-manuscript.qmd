California implemented a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) across the coast in 2007, reducing access to the recreational fishery.



The fishery-independent data source is an MPA monitoring survey along the central coast of California, the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP). The CCFRP expanded to cover additional monitoring areas in 2017, but we limit the the data in this paper to the core sampling area. 


he fishery-independent CCFRP dataset is similar in the a number of ways to the onboard observer data, in that it includes high resolution catch and effort data and uses the same gear as the recreational fleet, a single rod with two hooks per angler.
The CCFRP survey was designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling locations both inside and adjacent to MPAs [@starr_variation_2015a; @wendt_collaborative_2009].  The CCFRP survey began in 2007 along the central coast of California and was designed in collaboration with academics, NMFS scientists and fishermen. 
From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project sampled the central California coast, and has monitored four MPA and reference areas annually. In 2017, the CCFRP expanded coastwide within California to monitory 16 MPA and reference site pairs, invovling six university partners. The indices of abundance developed as an example here represent data from the four MPAs sampled consistently (A&ntilde;o Nuevo and Point Lobos by Moss Landing Marine Labs; Point Buchon and Piedras Blancas by Cal Poly).

The survey design for CCFRP consists 500 x 500 m cells both within and adjacent to each MPA. On any given survey day site cells are randomly selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells).  CPFVs are chartered for the survey and the fishing captain is allowed to search within the cell for a fishing location.  During a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of 30-45 minutes by volunteer anglers. Each fish encountered is recorded, measured, and released (or descended to depth). The CCFRP samples depth shallower than 30 fm to avoid barotrauma-induced mortality. For the index of abundance, CPUE was modeled at the level of the drift, similar to the fishery-dependent onboard observer survey described above. The CCFRP data are quality controlled at the time data were entered by each project partner.
