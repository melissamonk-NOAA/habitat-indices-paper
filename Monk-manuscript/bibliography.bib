abstract = {An initial step in catch and effort analysis is determination of what subset of the data is relevant to the analysis. We propose an objective approach to subsetting trip records of catch and effort data when fishing locations are unknown; the species composition taken on a fishing trip is used to infer if that trip's fishing effort occurred in a habitat where the species of interest (the target species) is likely to occur. We use a logistic regression of multispecies presence-absence information to predict the probability that the target species would be present. A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records. We test this approach by applying it to a data set where individual fishing locations are known, and we show that the method is an effective substitute for information on individual fishing locations. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Despite being one of the most common pieces of information used in assessing the status of fish stocks, relative abundance indices based on catch per unit effort (cpue) data are notoriously problematic. Raw cpue is seldom proportional to abundance over a whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because numerous factors affect catch rates. One of the most commonly applied fisheries analyses is standardization of cpue data to remove the effect of factors that bias cpue as an index of abundance. Even if cpue is standardized appropriately, the resulting index of relative abundance, in isolation, provides limited information for management advice or about the effect of fishing. In addition, cpue data generally cannot provide information needed to assess and manage communities or ecosystems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the use of cpue data and some methods to assess and provide management advice about fish populations that can help overcome these problems, including integrated stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and adaptive management. We also discuss the inappropriateness of using cpue data to evaluate the status of communities. We use tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean as examples. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

These indices can, however, be misleading because changes over time in catch rates can occur because of factors other than changes in abundance. Catch-effort standardization is used to attempt to remove the impact of these factors. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the methods for standardizing catch and effort data.

Data describing species, location, and size of schools can be inexpensively obtained from fish spotters but are difficult to interpret statistically. We developed an index of relative abundance from fish spotter data based on extended delta-lognormal models and applied the method to data for northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). In contrast with previous approaches, our method used all available data, provided an index for northern anchovy that was proportional to abundance, and explicitly modeled factors (pilots, regions, seasons, and time of day) that affected observations by fish spotters. We also included information about mixed layer depth and sea surface temperature in models for a reduced study area and found that envi- ronmental data, where available, can be used to improve estimates of relative abundance from fish spotter data. Simulation results indicated that our approach is a cost-effective way to improve biomass estimates for pelagic species like northern anchovy},

abstract = {Rockfishes of the genus Sebastes comprise one of the most important and heavily utilized groups of commercial and recreational fishes occurring off California. In this study, carried out primarily in the 1980s, we examined various aspects of life history for the nearshore rockfishes and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod off central California. The following species of rockfishes were those primarily considered within this study: black, black-and-yellow, blue, canary, China, copper, gopher, grass, green spotted, kelp, olive, rosy, starry, vermilion, yelloweye, and yellowtail. During the study, 21 species of rockfish and 8 additional species of fish, including cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod, were tagged and released to study patterns of movement. Of 7332 tagged fish, 197 (3%) representing 15 species, were recaptured. Of these, only three species (canary and yellowtail rockfishes and lingcod) manifested substantial movement. Most nearshore rockfishes appear to be highly residential. Age and growth parameters were determined for 15 species of rockfish. Whole otoliths were the primary structure utilized for ageing. Most nearshore rockfishes examined appear to have lifespans of moderate longevity, with maximum ages between 20 and 30 years. Weight-length relationships were calculated for 16 species of rockfish and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod. Reproductive patterns were determined for 18 species of rockfish and size at sexual maturation for 17 of these species. The majority of nearshore rockfishes appear to release larvae during the winter-spring period. However, timing of larval extrusion is species specific and must be examined on a case-by-case basis. General food habits were described for 11 species of rockfish. An Appendix, summarizing life-history characteristics for the 17 most commonly encountered species in this study, is included. We conclude that the nearshorerockfishes are a valuable marine resource to the State of California and should be managed with the realization that, as with many of the world's fishery resources, they are vulnerable to human impacts and over exploitation},

abstract = {We compiled 297 series of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and independent abundance data (as estimated by research trawl surveys) and used observation error and random effects models to test the hypothesis that CPUE is proportional to true abundance. We used a power curve, for which we were interested in the shape parameter ($\beta$). There was little difference among species, ages, or gear types in the distributions of the raw estimates of $\beta$ for each CPUE series. We examined three groups: cod, flatfish, and gadiformes, finding strong evidence that CPUE was most likely to remain high while abundance declines (i.e., hyperstability, where $\beta$ < 1). The range in the mean of the random effects distribution for $\beta$ was quite small, 0.64-0.75. Cod showed the least hyperstability, but still, 76% of the mass of the random effects distribution was below 1. Based on simulations, our estimates of $\beta$ are positively biased by approximately 10%; this should be considered in the application of our findings here. We also considered the precision of CPUE indices through a meta-analysis of observation error variances. The most precise indices were those from flatfish (median coefficient of variation of ≈0.42).},

abstract = {We used a caging system designed to minimize the adverse effects of caging fish in marine waters to evaluate the discard mortality of seven species of rockfish Sebastes with barotrauma. Altogether, 288 rockfish were captured, scored for barotrauma, evaluated behaviorally at the surface, and caged individually on the seafloor for 48 h to determine survival. With the exception of three blue rockfish S. mystinus, the condition of surviving fish after cage confinement from 41 to 71 h was excellent. At capture depths up to 54 m, survival was 100% for yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus (n = 25) and copper rockfish S. caurinus (n = 10) and 78% for blue rockfish (n = 36). At capture depths up to 64 m, survival was 100% for canary rockfish S. pinniger (n = 41) and quillback rockfish S. maliger (n = 28) and 90% for black rockfish S. melanops (n = 144). Black rockfish survival was negatively associated with capture depth (m) and the surface-bottom temperature differential (°C). Blue rockfish survival was negatively associated with capture depth. Barotrauma signs and surface behavior scores were not good indicators of survival potential across species but were useful within species. In black and blue rockfish, severe barotrauma was negatively associated with survival, while higher scores on reflex behaviors at the surface were positively associated with survival. The high survival rates and excellent condition of some species in this study suggest that requiring hook-and-line fishers to use recompression devices to help discarded rockfish return to depth may increase survival for some species. {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2012.},

Our primary interest was evaluating potential residence times for rockfish species in small, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) like those recently designated for Oregon waters (337–1,502 ha). We tagged 6 black rockfish S. melanops, 31 canary rockfish S. pinniger, 9 yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus, 5 quillback rockfish S. maliger, and 2 copper rockfish S. caurinus, along with single specimens of china rockfish S. nebulosus, vermilion rockfish S. miniatus, and tiger rockfish S. nigrocinctus, and monitored their movements with a large (about 5,200-ha) receiver grid for over a year. Canary rockfish showed low site fidelity and wide-ranging movements that exceeded the scale of our detection grid and a wide range of vertical movements (up to 27 m). Quillback, vermilion, tiger, china, and some yelloweye rockfish showed high site fidelity, being detected only at one or two nearby receivers for a full year. The range of vertical movements of yelloweye, quillback, vermilion, and tiger rockfish was small, ranging from only 2–3 m for the single tiger rockfish to 3–13 m for four of the quillback rockfish. Black and copper rockfish showed site fidelity that was intermediate between that of canary rockfish and the other species. Black and copper rockfish showed a wide range in vertical movements (10–35 m and 2–33 m, respectively) within a month. Our results suggest that small, no-take MPAs located on high-relief rocky reefs would provide minimal protection for canary rockfish, some protection for black and copper rockfish, and greater protection for quillback, vermilion, tiger, and some yelloweye rockfish. {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2011.},

abstract = {Fisheries that target fish spawning aggregations can exhibit hyperstability, in which catch per unit effort (CPUE) remains elevated as stock abundance declines, but empirical support is limited. We compiled several fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sets to assess stock trends in the barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) and the kelp bass (Paral-abrax clathratus) in southern California, USA, evaluate the interaction between spawning aggregations and fishing activities, and test for hyperstability. Annual and seasonal trends from fisheries and population data indicate that regional stocks of both species have collapsed in response to overfishing of spawning aggregations and changes in environmental conditions. The aggregating behavior of fish and persistent targeting of spawning aggregations by recreational fisheries combined to produce a hyperstable relationship between CPUE and stock abundance in both species, which created the illusion that population levels were stable and masked fishery collapses. Differences in the rate of decline between the two species may be related to the size, duration, and spatial distribution of their spawning aggregations. Results of this study provide empirical evidence of hyperstability in aggregation-based fisheries and demonstrate that CPUE data be used with caution and given low weight when fishery-independent data are available.},

abstract = {Stock Synthesis (SS) is a likelihood-based statistical catch-at-age modeling environment allowing multiple data sources to be used to characterize population dynamics through time. While it is typically applied in data-rich circumstances, its suitability in data-limited situations is investigated in this work. Two " Simple Stock Synthesis" (SSS) approaches are outlined, each developed to mimic the Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) estimation of overfishing limits (OFLs) currently applied to data-limited U.S. west coast groundfish species. SSS-MC uses Monte Carlo draws of natural mortality, steepness, and stock depletion and estimates initial recruitment, while SSS-MCMC estimates natural mortality, steepness, and initial recruitment while fitting to an artificial abundance survey representing stock depletion with an error distribution equivalent to the stock depletion prior used in DB-SRA. These approaches are applied to 45 species of unassessed groundfishes in the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and the OFL estimates are compared to corresponding DB-SRA estimates. Despite model structure and parameter specification differences, SSS led to results comparable to DB-SRA over a wide range of species and life histories. SSS models with sex-specific life history parameters and growth variability are also presented as examples of how the inherent flexibility of SS can be used to account for more uncertainty in derived quantities. SSS-MCMC, while exhibiting statistically undesirable traits due to the inclusion of the artificial survey, readily includes data-informed abundance surveys into an assessment framework consistent with more complex, data-informed assessments. Establishment of viable data-limited approaches in SS is a convenient first steps in " building-up" stock assessments towards fuller implementation in SS when additional data become available, while also providing a way to inform management in data-limited situations. {\textcopyright} 2012.},
