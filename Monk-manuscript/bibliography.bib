   abstract = {Fish-habitat associations were examined at three spatial scales in Monterey Bay, California, to determine how benthic habitats and landscape configuration have structured deepwater demersal fish assemblages. Fish counts and habitat variables were quantified by using observer and video data collected from a submersible. Fish responded to benthic habitats at scales ranging from cm's to km's. At broad-scales (km's), habitat strata classified from acoustic maps were a strong predictor of fish assemblage composition. At intermediate-scales (m's-100 m's), fish species were associated with specific substratum patch types. At fine-scales (<1 m), microhabitat associations revealed differing degrees of microhabitat specificity, and for some species revealed niche separation within patches. The use of habitat characteristics in ecosystem-based management, particularly as a surrogate for species distributions, will depend on resolving fish-habitat associations and habitat complexity over multiple scales.},

   abstract = {Construction of annual indices of stock abundance based on the standardisation of catch and effort data remains central to many fisheries assessments. However, while the use of advanced statistical methods has helped catch rates to be standardised accounting for many explanatory variables, some of the more routine aspects of constructing abundance indices, such as how the index is constructed from the model parameters, receives little explanation in many analyses. This has lead to a lack of understanding as to how the indices are constructed and in some instances incorrect techniques have been applied. This lack of understanding can be a particular issue when interactions are used in the standardising model, especially those which contain interactions with the temporal effects over which the time-series of the abundance index is required. Other issues include the use of weighted model fits, the influence of anomalous data values, how best to impute missing values when required, the consequences of model mis-specification, and the use of random-effects. In this study, the basic approach for constructing abundance indices is outlined and a worked example using simulated data is presented to explore the nature of these issues and several techniques are suggested for dealing with them and to overcome potential biases. Finally, the methods presently used by ICCAT scientists for constructing abundance indices are reviewed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Stock Synthesis (SS) is a likelihood-based statistical catch-at-age modeling environment allowing multiple data sources to be used to characterize population dynamics through time. While it is typically applied in data-rich circumstances, its suitability in data-limited situations is investigated in this work. Two " Simple Stock Synthesis" (SSS) approaches are outlined, each developed to mimic the Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) estimation of overfishing limits (OFLs) currently applied to data-limited U.S. west coast groundfish species. SSS-MC uses Monte Carlo draws of natural mortality, steepness, and stock depletion and estimates initial recruitment, while SSS-MCMC estimates natural mortality, steepness, and initial recruitment while fitting to an artificial abundance survey representing stock depletion with an error distribution equivalent to the stock depletion prior used in DB-SRA. These approaches are applied to 45 species of unassessed groundfishes in the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and the OFL estimates are compared to corresponding DB-SRA estimates. Despite model structure and parameter specification differences, SSS led to results comparable to DB-SRA over a wide range of species and life histories. SSS models with sex-specific life history parameters and growth variability are also presented as examples of how the inherent flexibility of SS can be used to account for more uncertainty in derived quantities. SSS-MCMC, while exhibiting statistically undesirable traits due to the inclusion of the artificial survey, readily includes data-informed abundance surveys into an assessment framework consistent with more complex, data-informed assessments. Establishment of viable data-limited approaches in SS is a convenient first steps in " building-up" stock assessments towards fuller implementation in SS when additional data become available, while also providing a way to inform management in data-limited situations. © 2012.},

   abstract = {Abundance indices derived from fisheries-dependent data (catch-per-unit-effort or CPUE) are known to have potential for bias, in part because of the usual non-random nature of fisheries spatial distributions. However, given the cost and lack of availability of fisheries-independent surveys, fisheries-dependent CPUE remains a common and informative input to fisheries stock assessments. Recent research efforts have focused on the development of spatiotemporal delta-generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) which simultaneously standardize the CPUE and predict abundance in unfished areas when estimating the abundance index. These models can include local seasonal environmental covariates (e.g. sea surface temperature) and a spatially varying response to regional annual indices (e.g. the El Niño Southern Oscillation) to interpolate into unfished areas. Spatiotemporal delta-GLMMs have been demonstrated in simulation studies to perform better than conventional, non-spatial delta-generalized linear models (GLMs). However, spatiotemporal delta-GLMMs have rarely been evaluated in situations where fisheries spatial sampling patterns change over time (e.g. fisheries expansion or spatial closures). This study develops a simulation framework to evaluate 1) how the nature of fisheries-dependent spatial sampling patterns may bias estimated abundance indices, 2) how shifts in spatial sampling over time impact our ability to estimate temporal changes in catchability, and 3) how including seasonal environmental covariates and/or regional annual indices in spatiotemporal delta-GLMMs can improve the estimation of abundance indices given shifts in spatial sampling. Spatiotemporal delta-GLMMs are then applied to a case study example where the spatial sampling pattern changed dramatically over time (contraction of the Japanese pole-and-line fishery for skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis in the western and central Pacific Ocean). Results from simulations indicate that spatial sampling in proportion to the underlying biomass can produce similar abundance indices to those produced under random sampling. Though estimated abundance indices were not perfect, spatiotemporal GLMMs were generally able to disentangle shifts in spatial sampling from temporal changes in catchability when shifts in spatial sampling were not too extreme. Lastly, the inclusion of seasonal environmental covariates and/or regional oceanographic indices in spatiotemporal GLMMs did not improve abundance index estimation and in some cases resulted in degraded model performance.},

   abstract = {Fisheries that target fish spawning aggregations can exhibit hyperstability, in which catch per unit effort (CPUE) remains elevated as stock abundance declines, but empirical support is limited. We compiled several fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sets to assess stock trends in the barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) and the kelp bass (Paral-abrax clathratus) in southern California, USA, evaluate the interaction between spawning aggregations and fishing activities, and test for hyperstability. Annual and seasonal trends from fisheries and population data indicate that regional stocks of both species have collapsed in response to overfishing of spawning aggregations and changes in environmental conditions. The aggregating behavior of fish and persistent targeting of spawning aggregations by recreational fisheries combined to produce a hyperstable relationship between CPUE and stock abundance in both species, which created the illusion that population levels were stable and masked fishery collapses. Differences in the rate of decline between the two species may be related to the size, duration, and spatial distribution of their spawning aggregations. Results of this study provide empirical evidence of hyperstability in aggregation-based fisheries and demonstrate that CPUE data be used with caution and given low weight when fishery-independent data are available.},

Altogether, 288 rockfish were captured, scored for barotrauma, evaluated behaviorally at the surface, and caged individually on the seafloor for 48 h to determine survival. With the exception of three blue rockfish S. mystinus, the condition of surviving fish after cage confinement from 41 to 71 h was excellent. At capture depths up to 54 m, survival was 100% for yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus (n = 25) and copper rockfish S. caurinus (n = 10) and 78% for blue rockfish (n = 36).

Black rockfish survival was negatively associated with capture depth (m) and the surface-bottom temperature differential (°C). Blue rockfish survival was negatively associated with capture depth. Barotrauma signs and surface behavior scores were not good indicators of survival potential across species but were useful within species. In black and blue rockfish, severe barotrauma was negatively associated with survival, while higher scores on reflex behaviors at the surface were positively associated with survival. The high survival rates and excellent condition of some species in this study suggest that requiring hook-and-line fishers to use recompression devices to help discarded rockfish return to depth may increase survival for some species. © American Fisheries Society 2012.},

We tagged 6 black rockfish S. melanops, 31 canary rockfish S. pinniger, 9 yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus, 5 quillback rockfish S. maliger, and 2 copper rockfish S. caurinus, along with single specimens of china rockfish S. nebulosus, vermilion rockfish S. miniatus, and tiger rockfish S. nigrocinctus, and monitored their movements with a large (about 5,200-ha) receiver grid for over a year. Canary rockfish showed low site fidelity and wide-ranging movements that exceeded the scale of our detection grid and a wide range of vertical movements (up to 27 m). Quillback, vermilion, tiger, china, and some yelloweye rockfish showed high site fidelity, being detected only at one or two nearby receivers for a full year. The range of vertical movements of yelloweye, quillback, vermilion, and tiger rockfish was small, ranging from only 2–3 m for the single tiger rockfish to 3–13 m for four of the quillback rockfish. Black and copper rockfish showed site fidelity that was intermediate between that of canary rockfish and the other species. Black and copper rockfish showed a wide range in vertical movements (10–35 m and 2–33 m, respectively) within a month.

We used a power curve, for which we were interested in the shape parameter (β). There was little difference among species, ages, or gear types in the distributions of the raw estimates of β for each CPUE series. We examined three groups: cod, flatfish, and gadiformes, finding strong evidence that CPUE was most likely to remain high while abundance declines (i.e., hyperstability, where β < 1). The range in the mean of the random effects distribution for β was quite small, 0.64-0.75. Cod showed the least hyperstability, but still, 76% of the mass of the random effects distribution was below 1. Based on simulations, our estimates of β are positively biased by approximately 10%; this should be considered in the application of our findings here. We also considered the precision of CPUE indices through a meta-analysis of observation error variances. The most precise indices were those from flatfish (median coefficient of variation of ≈0.42).},

Our objectives were to estimate the relative abundance of habitats and to examine demersal fish species composition, diversity, density, and sizes relative to these habitats. A total of 112 transects were completed covering 32 km of seafloor. A higher density of fishes was estimated in boulder and cobble habitats than in mud and brachiopod beds. More than 80% of the fishes were small, measuring 20 cm or less in total length. Species with small maximum size (primarily pygmy rockfish, Sebastes wilsoni, and blackeye gobies, Rhinogobiops nicholsii) accounted for nearly half (49%) of the total number of 12,441 fishes. Most fishes were immature, with only 4 of 20 harvested species having more than 50% of the individuals larger than the size at first maturity. Our study area on the continental shelf may be an ontogenetic transition zone for immature fishes before they move to their adult habitat on the slope. Alternatively, historical fishing pressure may have contributed to the lack of large, mature fishes in the survey area. Understanding the importance of these habitats to fishes at various life stages will improve our ability to assess these deepwater fish stocks and effectively manage these living resources on an ecosystem basis.},

Three basic patterns of space use were identified: (1) a shelter hole located within a larger area of activity (in which the fish presumably fed, since its size increased with size of fish and decreased with prey density); (2) discontinuous home ranges, in which the shelter holes and feeding areas were separte; and (3) dispersed home ranges with little or no exclusive area. Fish in the first category were regarded as territorial, since their home ranges were defended and relatively exclusive. Because individuals did not patrol borders, however, territories often overlapped at their peripheries. In addition, some territory holders appeared to tolerate the sheltering of other fish within their territories, as long as these intruders left the territory during periods of activity. Some fish with discontinuous home ranges ("commuters") may have been territorial, but others may have been forced to occupy suboptimal feeding areas. Fish in the third category ("floaters") were regarded as nonterritorial; their activities were apparently limited to areas where they could escape the aggression of territory holders. The varying patterns appeared to develop through defense and accommodation during the turnover of individuals, with each fish securing shelter and feeding areas as these became available. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

In this study, carried out primarily in the 1980s, we examined various aspects of life history for the nearshore rockfishes and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod off central California. The following species of rockfishes were those primarily considered within this study: black, black-and-yellow, blue, canary, China, copper, gopher, grass, green spotted, kelp, olive, rosy, starry, vermilion, yelloweye, and yellowtail. During the study, 21 species of rockfish and 8 additional species of fish, including cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod, were tagged and released to study patterns of movement. Of 7332 tagged fish, 197 (3%) representing 15 species, were recaptured. Of these, only three species (canary and yellowtail rockfishes and lingcod) manifested substantial movement. Most nearshore rockfishes appear to be highly residential. Age and growth parameters were determined for 15 species of rockfish. Whole otoliths were the primary structure utilized for ageing. Most nearshore rockfishes examined appear to have lifespans of moderate longevity, with maximum ages between 20 and 30 years. Weight-length relationships were calculated for 16 species of rockfish and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod. Reproductive patterns were determined for 18 species of rockfish and size at sexual maturation for 17 of these species. The majority of nearshore rockfishes appear to release larvae during the winter-spring period. However, timing of larval extrusion is species specific and must be examined on a case-by-case basis. General food habits were described for 11 species of rockfish. An Appendix, summarizing life-history characteristics for the 17 most commonly encountered species in this study, is included. We conclude that the nearshorerockfishes are a valuable marine resource to the State of California and should be managed with the realization that, as with many of the world's fishery resources, they are vulnerable to human impacts and over exploitation},

   abstract = {The authors investigated various life history aspects of 19 rockfish species (Sebastes chlorostictus, S. constellatus, S. dalli, S. elongatus, S. ensifer, S. entomelas, S. flavidus, S. goodei, S. hopkinsi, S. levis, S. melanostomus, S. miniatus, S. ovalis, S. paucispinis, S. rosaceus, S. rosenblatti, S. rufus, s. saxicola, S. semicinctus) from the southern California Bight. These aspects included depth distribution, age-length relationships (of 7 spe- cies), length-weight relationships, size at first maturity, spawn- ing season, and fecundity. Growth rates of female S. elongatus, S. hopkinsi, S. ova/is, S. saxicola, and S. semicinctus were higher than male conspecifics. Multiple spawning per season was found in 12 species. Generally, most species spawned between late winter and early summer, though there was some spawning within the genus throughout the year. Spawning season dura- tion ranged from 2 (S. flavidus) to 10 months (S. paucispinis). Spawning seasons tended to start earlier in the year and be of longer duration in the southern California Bight, compared to published data on central California conspecifics. Males matured at a smaller length in 7 of the 17 species studied. Maximum fecundities ranged from 18,000 (S. dalll) to about 2,680,000 (S. levis).},

   abstract = {The primary indices of abundance for many of the world's most valuable species (e.g. tunas) and vulnerable species (e.g. sharks) are based on catch and effort data collected from commercial and recreational fishers. These indices can, however, be misleading because changes over time in catch rates can occur because of factors other than changes in abundance. Catch-effort standardization is used to attempt to remove the impact of these factors. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the methods for standardizing catch and effort data. It outlines the major estimation approaches being applied, the methods for dealing with zero observations, how to identify and select appropriate explanatory variables, and how standardized catch rate data can be used when conducting stock assessments. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Despite being one of the most common pieces of information used in assessing the status of fish stocks, relative abundance indices based on catch per unit effort (cpue) data are notoriously problematic. Raw cpue is seldom proportional to abundance over a whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because numerous factors affect catch rates. One of the most commonly applied fisheries analyses is standardization of cpue data to remove the effect of factors that bias cpue as an index of abundance. Even if cpue is standardized appropriately, the resulting index of relative abundance, in isolation, provides limited information for management advice or about the effect of fishing. In addition, cpue data generally cannot provide information needed to assess and manage communities or ecosystems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the use of cpue data and some methods to assess and provide management advice about fish populations that can help overcome these problems, including integrated stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and adaptive management. We also discuss the inappropriateness of using cpue data to evaluate the status of communities. We use tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean as examples. © 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

@article{Miller:2014:SDH,
   abstract = {During the past century, commercial fisheries have expanded from small vessels fishing in shallow, coastal habitats to a broad suite of vessels and gears that fish virtually every marine habitat on the globe. Understanding how fisheries have developed in space and time is critical for interpreting and managing the response of ecosystems to the effects of fishing, however time series of spatially explicit data are typically rare. Recently, the 1933-1968 portion of the commercial catch dataset from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife was recovered and digitized, completing the full historical series for both commercial and recreational datasets from 1933-2010. These unique datasets include landing estimates at a coarse 10 by 10 minute "grid-block" spatial resolution and extends the entire length of coastal California up to 180 kilometers from shore. In this study, we focus on the catch history of groundfish which were mapped for each grid-block using the year at 50% cumulative catch and total historical catch per habitat area. We then constructed generalized linear models to quantify the relationship between spatiotemporal trends in groundfish catches, distance from ports, depth, percentage of days with wind speed over 15 knots, SST and ocean productivity. Our results indicate that over the history of these fisheries, catches have taken place in increasingly deeper habitat, at a greater distance from ports, and in increasingly inclement weather conditions. Understanding spatial development of groundfish fisheries and catches in California are critical for improving population models and for evaluating whether implicit stock assessment model assumptions of relative homogeneity of fisheries removals over time and space are reasonable. This newly reconstructed catch dataset and analysis provides a comprehensive appreciation for the development of groundfish fisheries with respect to commonly assumed trends of global fisheries patterns that are typically constrained by a lack of long-term spatial datasets.},

   abstract = {This paper describes a method for the analysis of groundfish survey data by incorporating zero and non-zero values into a single model. This is done by using a model which modifies the delta-distribution approach to fit into the GLM framework and uses maximum likelihood to estimate parameters. No prior assumptions of homogeneity are used for the structure of the zero or non-zero values. The method is primarily applicable to fixed-station designs, although extensions to other designs are possible. The maximum likelihood estimation reduces to fitting a GLM to 0/1 values and another GLM to the positive abundance values. The new model is tested on Icelandic groundfish survey data. It is seen that the model can be used for evaluating the effect of different factors on catch rates as well as estimating abundance indices. Results from different models are compared on the basis of tuned VPA runs. © 1996 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

   abstract = {An initial step in catch and effort analysis is determination of what subset of the data is relevant to the analysis. We propose an objective approach to subsetting trip records of catch and effort data when fishing locations are unknown; the species composition taken on a fishing trip is used to infer if that trip's fishing effort occurred in a habitat where the species of interest (the target species) is likely to occur. We use a logistic regression of multispecies presence-absence information to predict the probability that the target species would be present. A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records. We test this approach by applying it to a data set where individual fishing locations are known, and we show that the method is an effective substitute for information on individual fishing locations. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.
