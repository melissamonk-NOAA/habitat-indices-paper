# Introduction

Integrated fisheries stock assessment models utilize a variety of data sources to develop the most complete picture of the stock and current status in relation to management thresholds. Catch data is
a primary input to stock assessments and informs the overall magnitude of the stock. Catch data are often input with the assumption that the removals are known with absolute precision, i.e., there is
no error associated with removals. Fisheries survey and catch data are used to develop standardized indices of abundance that inform fisheries stock assessment models [@Maunder:2004:SCE]. A
standardized index of abundance informs the model on the size of the population during a particular year or years, either as an absolute value or a relative value. An absolute index of abundance is an
estimate of the true density of fish in a particular area and is most commonly estimated from visual survey data. An absolute index is oftentimes input as a single year due to the high cost associated
with determining total fish abundance within an area [@Love:2009:DFA].

More often, an index of abundance is a relative measure of the population and requires a time series to inform the stock assessment model. An index of relative abundance assumes that changes in the
index are proportional to changes of abundance in the population [@Harley:2001:CUE]. Fishery-independent data collected from standardized survey designs provide a more unbiased estimation of the trend
in a fisheries population. However, fishery-independent surveys are costly, labor intensive and often require a long time series to be considered informative in fisheries stock assessments. When
fishery-independent data are not available, stock assessment scientists make use of the best available data, which may often only include fishery-dependent data.

Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is a common metric available from fisheries and collected on surveys. Depending on the stock assessment model and the available data for a particular fish stock, an index
of stock status can have a large influence on end year estimation of stock status (find examples).

There are both advantages and disadvantages that must be considered when using to fishery-dependent data. Fishery-dependent data are collected directly from the the fishery and are less costly than
the whose operations are not constrained by sampling designs, but dependent on the behaviors of the captain and vessel and, in the case of recreational trips, customer preference.

Fishery-dependent data are only collected from areas legally open areas can be collected, i.e., areas closed to fishing are not sampled. In California, this includes a network of marine protected
areas (MPAs), rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) developed based on depth closures, and varying seasonal and depth closures that vary temporally and spatially along California's coastline.
Fishery-independent surveys are conducted using a scientific study design and, depending on the study, are not always confined to the same regulations as the commercial and recreational fishing
sectors. In an ideal situation, both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent surveys would used to inform the stock assessment model.

Fishery-dependent surveys sample the fishing fleets and are subject to potential sampling biases. The sampling is dependent on the fishing boat's behavior, which is to maximize catch. Sampling of the
fishing fleet is often opportunistic based on the availability of samplers and the availability of trips to sample. Sampling the fisheries can also be constrained to the current regulations, which may
prohibit the retention of a species or fishing at certain depths, i.e., California Department of Fish and Wildlife has varying spatial and temporal depth and season closures implemented through six
management regions. There is also a fairly new network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) designated from 2007-2012 that prohibit recreational fishing, and are therefore areas no longer sampled by the
recreational fishing fleet. However, the advantage to fishery-dependent sampling the reduced program cost compared to a more intensive fishery-independent survey.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council manages groundfish off the West Coast of the United States under the Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The FMP includes 64 species of rockfish, \_\_\_ of
which do not have full stock assessments. Many of these species, especially those nearshore, are assessed using multiple assessment models to represent areas with distinct fishing histories,
communities regulations. Along the U.S. West Coast, even if the stock assessment is categorized as data rich, oftentimes the only index of abundance available is from a fishery-dependent CPUE time
series of observed recreational angler catch rates [@Cope:2013:ISC].

A common characteristic of ecological data is a high proportion of zero observations across samples and the question as to whether the sampling occurred within the species' habitat and the species was
not observed or if the sampling occurred outside of the species' habitat (structural zeroes). Fisheries survey data are often subset to exclude structural zeroes using the Stephens-MacCall method
[-@Stephens:2004:MAS], which models the probability of observing the target species given the other the presence/absence of other species. However, the onboard observer survey collected
location-specific information on each observer fish encounter. To subset the onboard observer survey data and exclude structural zeroes, we used the positive catch locations as a proxy for suitable
habitat.

We evaluated data from a recreational onboard observer program, which collects location- and species-specific CPUE information from the commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV; also know as party
boat) fleet [@Monk:2014:DRD]. The data are collected at the level of a fishing drift and fine-scale habitat data are available for a large fraction of California state waters. To determine the impact
and effect of developing indices with data from known fishing locations mapped to rocky reef habitat to indices without known habitat information, we used the same data set to develop standardized
indices of relative abundance based on three different data filtering methods. The three data treatment methods included an aggregation of the catches at the drift-level data to a trip, treating the
drift-level data as if specific locations were not available, and lastly filtering the drift-level data based on known locations. In addition, for the model filtered based on known rocky reef
substrate, we weighted the index by area of habitat within pre-defined regions.

Prior to 2013, these data has not been used to develop an index of abundance for West Coast fisheries stock assessments. That was partially due to the availability of data and at that point in time
not many full stock assessments had been conducted for the nearshore groundfish species. These data were first used without the habitat data in the 2013 data moderate stock assessments for xxx, xxx,
and xxx, where data were filtered using positive species observations and an alpha hull method in ArcMap (cite).

The availability of high-resolution bathymetry data described in (xxx), provided an opportunity to overlay each individual drift onto known habitat type (hard vs. soft substrate), and has been the
method utilized since 2015.

The Stephens-MacCall [-@Stephens:2004:MAS] filtering approach was used to predict the probability of encountering the target species, based on the species composition of the catch in a given trip. The
method uses presence/absence data within a logistic regression to identify the probability of encountering a target species given the presence or absence of other predictor species.

We applied three methods of data filtering to determine how each affected a standardized index of abundance across six species with varying life histories, habitat preference and prevelence in the
data. All of the drift-level catches were aggregated to the trip-level to explore how the resolution of the same dataset affects the selection of samples based on the Stephens-MacCall method. The
Stephens-MacCall method was then applied to the catch at each drift, but no habitat information was used in the development of the index. The third method filtered the data based on the proximity to
rocky habitat, and we

This method is commonly used to filter data that are collected dockside after a vessel returns to port.

We utilized the availability of high resolution onboard observed fishing catch and effort data at the drift-level and habitat data at a 2 m resolution to explore how data selection methos and the
resulting indices would change if the data were only available at a courser resolution, or habitat data were not available. We accomplished this by aggregate the high resolution drift-level data back
to a trip and applying a commonly used method for subsetting data, the Stephens-MacCall method. As an intermediate step between mapping the drifts to habitat and aggregating the data to a trip and
ingoring habitat, we applied the Stephens-MacCall method to the drift-level data and assumed no habitat data were available.

After each dataset was filtered, an index of relative abundance was created. In addition, for the high-resolution drift level data filtered with known habitat, we took the same dataset and created an
area-weighted index.

*cut from another place: The onboard observer data provide a high-resolution of catch, effort and the ability to map the fishing drifts to fine-scale habitat data. This paper explores methodological
differences in data treatment to see what we gain by having the high-resolution habitat data and using that as a mechanism to filter out trips that are not targeting the species of interest*

*This paper explores methodological differences in data treatment to determine changes in trends in indices and the associated error among three alternative assumptions and data filtering strategies.
All of the methods described below started with the same subset of drifts from the onboard observer data, restricted to state waters and the years 2004-2016. In the case of application to stock
assessments, all potential data are explored, which may be why trends in indices differ in this paper than what has previously been published in stock assessments. Since the most recent stock
assessments in 2021, the data have undergone a major quality assurance effort by the authors.*

# Methods

## Survey Data and Habitat Assignment

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) began a fishery-dependent onboard observer survey of the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV or party/charter boat) fleet in 1999. In 2004,
the survey became part of the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CFRS) that includes additional surveys to quantify the catches and effort of the recreational fleet. Sampling effort for
groundfish-targeted CPFV trips was distributed in proportion to fishing effort, and approximately 21% of the CDFW observed groundfish trips were north of Point Conception. North of Bodega Bay,
California the majority of charter boats are smaller 6-pack vessel that may not have the capacity to carry an observer onboard. In 2001, the California Polytechnic State University Institute of Marine
Science, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) began a supplemental onboard observer program of the CPFV fleet based in Port Avila and Port San Luis along the Central Coast \[#fig-map\].

During an trip, observers recorded information for each fishing drift, defined as a period starting when the captain announced "Lines down" to when the captain instructed anglers to reel lines up.
Just prior to the start of each fishing drift, the sampler selected a subset of anglers to observe, at a maximum of 15 anglers per drift. The sampler recorded all fish encountered (retained and
discarded) by the subset of anglers as a group, i.e., catch cannot be attributed to an individual angler. Samplers also recorded the start and end times of the drift, coordinates of the fishing drift
(start latitude/longitude and for most drifts, end latitude/longitude), and minimum and maximum bottom depth. Fish encountered by the group of observed anglers were recorded to the species level as
either retained or discarded, providing a count of each species at a particular location. The CDFW measured all of the discarded fish during an observed trip, while the retained fish were measured
during an angler interview. Protocols for the Cal Poly survey were the same as the CDFW survey, with the exception that Cal Poly measured retained and discarded fish from observed anglers.

The SWFSC developed a relational database for the CDFW onboard survey from 1999-2010 [-@Monk:2014:DRD], and received more current data from the CDFW. The Cal Poly data were provided to the SWFSC
annually. All data were checked for errors at the drift-level by SWFSC staff. Where identifiable errors could be corrected within the CDFW database (i.e., obvious transcription of latitude or
longitude), we made those changes and denoted them in the database. Errors identified in the Cal Poly database were checked against the original datasheets and corrected when appropriate.

All of the drifts with a starting latitude and longitude were overlaid with the identified rocky habitat from the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) (citation). The CSMP collected bathymetry
in California state waters (3 nm from shore) north of of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$). Rough (rocky) and smooth (sandy) substrate were identified by CSMP using two rugosity indices,
surface:planar area, and vector ruggedness measure (VRM). Becky can you add a bit more here?

We considered raster cells identified as rough as rocky reef habitat. Individual reefs at the finest scale were defined as raster cells of rough with 200 m of another raster cell. The 200 m distance
was chosen based on evidence that a number of nearshore rockfish exhibit site fidelity and tagging studies have recaptured close to original capture sites [@Lea:1999:BAM; @Matthews:1985:SSM;
@Hannah:2011:SFM; @Hannah:2012:UNC]. Contiguous raster cells classified as hard substrate remained as a singular rocky reef, regardless of size. Reefs were further defined with a 5 m buffer to account
for potential error in positional accuracy. The area of rocky habitat for this paper was calculated to exclude portions of the reef that extended outside of California state waters (further than 3 nm
from shore). The mapped area does not include the white zones close to shore, which extends approximately 200-500 m from the shoreline. Fishing by the CPFV fleet is usually limited in the white zone
due to shallow depths and kelp beds. We assigned fishing drifts to reefs based on the recorded start location of a drift, given that the end locations of drifts were not always recorded, and in the
interest of maximizing effort, we did not quality check the end locations. The distance from the recorded drift start location to the nearest raster cell of rocky habitat was calculated in meters.

## Data Filtering

Data filtering methods were applied to both the drift-level data and the trip-level data. We aggregated the retained fish caught during a single trip. Discarded with were not included in this analysis
as they often represent a different size structure of fish, either due to size limits or angler preference. Prior to any filtering a total of 19,425 drifts that aggregated to 2,270 trips were
available for the analyses north of Point Conception.

Before applying the Stephens-MacCall method, we identified potentially informative predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage to inform the binomial model.

For the drift-level data that assumed no knowledge of habitat information, the Stephens-MacCall filter was applied with each individual drift as a sample. Species that never co-occurred with the
target species and those present in fewer than 1% of all drifts and 3% of all trips were removed to reduce the number of species to those that were informative. A lower threshold was selected for the
drift-level data to the change in magnitude of the number of samples when using drifts vs trips.

The remaining species all co-occurred with the target species in at least one trip and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a
binomial generalized linear model) were positive for species that are more likely to co-occur with the target species, and negative for species that were less likely to be caught with target species.
The intercept represented the probability of observing only the target species in a sample. We also calculated the 95% confidence interval for each coefficient.

Stephens and MacCall [-@Stephens:2004:MAS] recommended including all trips above a threshold where the false negatives and false positives are equally balanced. However, this does not have any
biological relevance and for this particular data set where trained observers identify all fish. We assumed that if the target species was encountered, the vessel fished in appropriate habitat.
Stephens and MacCall [-@Stephens:2004:MAS] proposed filtering (excluding) samples from index standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives and false negatives from
the predicted probability of encounter. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to encounter the target species based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False negatives
(FN) are trips that were not predicted to encounter the target species, given the catch composition, but caught at least one target species.

Of interest for the index of abundance is the elimination of trips that had a low probability of catching the target species given the other species caught on the trip. Therefore, we retained all of
the trips that caught the target species and those trips that did not catch the target species, but had a probability higher than the threshold balancing the false negatives and false positives. This
practice has commonly been used in recent stock assessments of rockfish on the West Coast.

#### Indices of Abundance

The trip-level effort was calculated as angler days, using the average number of observed anglers across all drifts on a trip. The trip-level index used all available data before any filtering was
done to exclude individual drifts with missing effort or location data, which allowed us to retain as much information about a trip as possible.

Standardized indices of abundance were generated for each data filtering method and an area-weighted index was developed from the drift-level habitat data. All indices were modeled using Bayesian
generalized linear models (GLMs) and the delta method [@Lo:1992:IRA]. The delta method models the data with two separate GLMs; one for the probability of encountering the species of interest from a
binomial likelihood and a logit link function and the second GLM models the positive encounters with either gamma or lognormal error structure.

The response variable for the positive models was angler-retained catch per unit effort. Year was always included in model selection, even if it was found to not be significant, because the goal of
the index of abundance was to extract the year effect.

Covariates for the trip-level data and drift-level data without habitat included wave (a 3-month aggregated period of time) and county of landing. Covariates considered for the drift-level data with
habitat filters included, aggregated reef area and wave. Each drift-level index with habitat information was also modeled to include a year/reef iteration and weighted based on reef area.

Year was always included in the trip-level data were 3-month wave and county of landing. Covariates considered for the drift-level data included, region, 3-month wave, and xxxx.

The gamma or lognormal error distribution was chosen via maximum likelihood AIC from the full model with all covariates. Model selection for the binomial and positive observation models were also
selected using AIC and unless very different predictors were selected, the same predictors were used in each of the two Bayesian models. The Bayesian models were run with 5,000 iterations and
uninformative priors. Posterior predictive model checks were examined for both the binomial and positive observation models. including xxxxxxx. We constructed the final year index by multiplying the
back-transformed posterior draws from the binomial model with the exponentiated positive model draws, and taking the mean and standard deviation for each year.

The area-weighted index was developed by extracting the posterior draws of from each year and area combination of the binomial and positive posterior predictions, and then summing across the product
of the posteriors weighted by the fraction of total area within each reef.

To better compare the resulting indices across the three data filtering methods and the area-weighted index, each index was scaled to its mean value.

Versions of the indices filtered based on habitat were approved by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council's Science and Statistical Committee for use in the 2013 stock assessments and have been used
all of the stock assessment process since. Comparisons should not be drawn between the indices presented here and the stock assessment documents as the indices in this paper were simplified to develop
direct comparisons among methods.

We explored the methods described in the following sections to develop indices of abundance for six species or species complexes of management interest: black rockfish (*Sebastes melanops*), blue and
deacon rockfish complex (*Sebastes mystinus*, *Sebastes diaconus*), brown rockfish (*Sebastes auriculatus*), China rockfish (*Sebastes nebulosus*), gopher rockfish (*Sebastes carnatus*), and vermilion
and sunset rockfish complex (*Sebastes miniatus*/*Sebastes crocotulus*). Two genetically distinct species compose a cryptic species pair that are often visually indistinguishable, or for other
reasons, were not recorded separately in surveys or catch histories. Gopher rockfish was assessed as part of a species complex with black-and-yellow rockfish (*Sebastes chrysomelus*) in 2019, but were
visually identifiable and the data in this paper represents only gopher rockfish [@Monk:2019:CSG]. Add in a sentence with species characteristics??

# Results

## Survey Data and Habitat Assignment

The dataset was filtered for errors within the relational database before

The additional of the Cal Poly data to the CDFW survey increased the sample sizes of observed trips out of San Luis Obispo county by an average of 155% from 2004-2016.

We defined 108 areas of rocky habitat on the finest scale within California state waters from Point Conception to the California/Oregon border. After exploratory analyses and considering the the
availability of data, the areas rocky habitat was grouped into six regions to ensure adequate sample sizes for developing indices of abundance (Figure \@fig-map). For the methods comparisons, we
aggregated the areas of deeper waters near the Farallon Islands off the coast of San Francisco and Monterey Bay. Depth was not considered as a covariate in the indices, but is often a significant
factor in index development for nearshore rockfish, with rockfish communities separated by depth \[Love et al\].

The region defined from the California/Oregon to San Francisco encompasses 49% of the total rocky habitat in state waters by area, but only 12% of the observed drifts fished in this area. Each of the
four remaining nearshore regions from San Francisco to Point Conception contained an average of 11% of the available habitat. The Cal Poly onboard observer program increased the number of observed
drifts from Big Sur to Point Conception by 155%, all years combined.

The regions of rocky habitat were further aggregated depending on available data for each species in order to model the GLM with positive encounters, i.e., black rockfish has a more northerly
distribution reflected in the aggregation of data from Santa Cruz and south, whereas brown rockfish is distributed across coastal California (Figure xxx).

The distribution of the speci

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of more than one species or species complex
("mixed trips") can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat associations informative for an index of abundance.

A look at the distirbution of each species by the percent of positive observations (over all years) and the average CPUE at the drift-level by aggregated areas of rocky habitat are presented in Figure
xxx.

9,425 drifts that aggregated to 2,252 trips that retained at least only trips were excluded from the

Trip level data resulted in xxxx trips

The data contained a total of 19,425 fishing drifts and after removing drifts with missing effort information (time fished or observed anglers), 19,180 remained. To further remove drifts that may not
accurately define a successful fishing drift or data errors, the upper and lower 1% of the recorded fish time and observed anglers were removed. This resulted in fishing drifts lasting between three
and 96 minutes fished with three to 15 observed anglers, reducing the data to 18,591 fishing drifts.

For indices incorporating habitat information, we filtered the data on depth to retain 99% of drifts, which resulted in a depth cutoff of 46.6 fathoms and retained 18,405 drifts. We did not use depth
as a predictor in the indices. The fishery was closed deeper than 40 fathoms for the entire time period from 2004-2016, and the additional 6 fathoms is within the scope of error given the rugous
bottom habitat.

The distance from rocky reef composed the last filter for indices including habitat. Using the drifts with the target species, we retained 90% of drift from the cumulative frequency of distance to
rocky habitat. The cutoff for blue, China and gopher rockfish was six meters, eight meters for vermilion rockfish, 14 meters for black rockfish and 16 meters for brown rockfish.

The percent of the samples retained for each data method differed by species, but followed the general trend that the lowest percent of samples were retained from the Stephens-MacCall filtering at the
drift level, ranging from 12% of samples retained for China rockfish and 54% for blue rockfish. A much higher percent of samples were retained both from the other two methods, with an average of 83%
of drifts retained when habitat was included as a filter. The species retained for the trip-level and drift-level Stephens-MacCall filtering were similar across species

For the drfit level data, the Stephens-MacCall data does retain drifts off the reefs

Data filtering for the indices with data aggregated to the trip-level and using the status quo of retaining all positive observations resulted in a high proportion of positive samples (0.70 - 0.86)
for all species.

# Discussion

The majority of groundfish species targeted by the CPFV fleet north of Point Conception during the time period of this study all have high associations to rocky habitat. In this case, the
Stephens-MacCall method can be considered a proxy for habitat when the species of interest has known associations

When filtering and modelling data for a stock assessment, additional filtering steps would be taken, such as excluding areas where species are rare, e.e., south of Santa Cruz for black rockfish.
However, this is also a function of the lower sampling rates along the coast north of San Francisco.

These models also do not account for distance to the nearest port, which has been shown to significantly impact the access to fish as well as historical fishing pressure....In addition, in 2004 the
CDFW implements spatial and temporal closures to the recreational nearshore groundfish fishery. There are currently XX management areas and recreational fishing is restricted shoreward of 20 fathoms
in the northern regions of the state to a deep as 40 fathoms in areas north of Point Conception.

The CRFS onboard observer program prioritizes trips with groundfish target species. There is not a mixed fishery in California north of Point Conception. The main bottom fish target is sanddabs

The recreational fishery in southern California is more of a mixed fishery and a trip is often not purely groundfish.

This is one

Retained catch for a given recreational is dependent on a number of factors including weather, distance from port, the clientele preferences, angler experience and captain's knowledge.

The high proportion of retained drifts across species when using habitat as a data filter indicates that hate majority of drifts occurred over, or very close to, rocky habitat.

Oftentimes a captain will position the vessel adjacent to rocky habitat so that the current allows the vessel to drift over the rocky habitat.

The fishery-dependent indices of abundance undergo higher levels of scrutiny during stock assessment reviews due to the nature of the data being driven by fisher behavior. The one fishery-independent
survey for nearshore groundfish in California north of California tends to have similar trends to the fishery-dependent indices for the shallower nearshore species like gopher and China rockfish.

Both blue and black rockfish have high affinity to rocky habitat, but occur higher off the bottom and are both schooling species. It is not uncommon to have a a drift dominated by blue rockfish.

However, the Stephen-MacCall approach does not account for this by modeling presence/absence.

The choice of a threshold value to use as a data filter from the Stephen-MacCall method should be reviewed to determine how sensitive an index of abundance is to that method. The

Recent studies have identified the need to investigate the assumptions and uncertainty in relative indices of abundance from visual surveys [@Bacheler:2015:ERA; @Campbell:2015:CRA] and simulation

Survey indices can be either absolute or relative. In the case of an absolute index of abundance, the entire population within the sampling area is accounted for and the index also provides
information on the density of the fish species within that area as well as aid in scaling the population size within the stock assessment model. Most indices of abundance are relative due to the fact
that the entire population within the survey area was not observed. Estimates of absolute abundance are difficult to obtain, especially for cryptic rockfishes. The cowcod (*Sebastes levis*) stock
assessments is one of the only West Coast stock assessments that has incorporated an estimate of absolute abundance, derived from a visual survey [@Love:2009:DFA] add assessment. The majority of stock
assessments include one or more index of relative abundance.

Data were limited to the California coast north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$). The composition of the fish communities in southern California differ, and the recreational fisheries are
fundamentally different, with a higher percentage of trips targeting mixed species and pelagic and highly migratory species, as well as more limited access to rocky habitat nearshore. Point Conception
is a biogeographic break (citation) and a number of stock assessments In addition, complete habitat data are not available for areas in southern California. The data were also temporally restricted to
the years 2001-2016. Earlier and more recent data were excluded to preserve a dataset with the most consistent gear and depth regulations.

Composition data from recreational surveys had the largest impact on simulation results, but individual survey components did not have individual effects on benchmarks [@Siegfried:2016:ISA].\

The onboard observer surveys decrease the amount of uncertainty, but relative to a fishery-independent survey, is still high....

A key assumption of the onboard observer programs is that fishing behavior remains the same when observers are not onboard the vessel. If a captain only fishes particular locations or targets a
different suite of species when an observer is onboard the vessel, additional bias is introduced in the data
