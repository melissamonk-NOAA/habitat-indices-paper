# Introduction

Melissa will refocus the introduction - I keep changing my mind.

Integrated fisheries stock assessment models utilize a variety of data sources to develop the most complete picture of the stock and current status in relation to management thresholds.

Catch per unit effort is one

More often(TYPICALLY??), an index of abundance is used as a relative measure of the population and requires a time series to inform the stock assessment model. An index of relative abundance assumes
that changes in the index are proportional to changes of abundance in the population [@Harley:2001:CUE]. Fishery-independent data collected from standardized survey designs provide a more unbiased
estimation of the trend in a fisheries population. However, fishery-independent surveys are costly, labor intensive and often require a long time series to be considered informative in fisheries stock
assessments. In an ideal situation, both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent surveys would be used to inform the stock assessment model. However, there are cases when only fishery-dependent data
are available and the caveats of each data stream must be considered (cite assessments). Fishery-dependent data are collected directly from the the fishery and are less costly than (than what????) the
whose operations are not constrained by sampling designs, but dependent on the behaviors of the captain and vessel and, in the case of recreational trips, customer preference.

Fishery-dependent surveys sample the fishing fleets and are subject to potential sampling biases. The sampling is dependent on the fishing boat's behavior, which is to maximize catch. Sampling of the
fishing fleet is often opportunistic based on the availability of samplers and the availability of trips to sample. Sampling the fisheries can also be constrained to the current regulations, which may
prohibit the retention of a species or fishing at certain depths, i.e., California Department of Fish and Wildlife has varying spatial and temporal depth and season closures implemented through six
management regions. There is also a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) designated from 2007-2012 that prohibit recreational fishing, and are therefore areas no longer sampled by the recreational
fishing fleet.

*Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is a common metric available from fishery-dependent surveys [@Maunder:2004:SCE].*

A common characteristic of ecological data is a high proportion of zero observations across samples and the question as to whether the sampling occurred within the species' habitat and the species was
not observed or if the sampling occurred outside of the species' habitat (structural zeroes). **you might mention someplace in introduction that nearshore rockfish are closely associated with rocky
habitat-- perhaps here. ?** Fisheries survey data are often subset to exclude structural zeroes using the Stephens-MacCall method
[-@Stephens:2004:MAS], which models the probability of observing the target species given the other the presence/absence of other species. However, the onboard observer survey collected
location-specific information on each observer fish encounter. To subset the onboard observer survey data and exclude structural zeroes,we used the positive catch locations (I DON"T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
THIS SENTENCE- only postiive catches are included?) this sentence seems like it is in the wrong place? more of a methods?) as a proxy for suitable habitat.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council's Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) contains 64 groundfish species off the West Coast of the United States. The data needs are large and as of 2022, xx xx
species have not had a full age-structured stock assessment in at least one area of the coast, e.g., yellowtail rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*)and kelp greenling (*Hexagrammos decagrammus*) do not have
accepted stock assessments for California. In some cases a stock assessment may be categorized as data rich, but the only index of abundance available is from a fishery-dependent CPUE time series of
observed recreational angler catch rates [@Cope:2013:ISC]. (THIS PARAGRAPH SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BETTER FIT HERE?? or state in a sentence that this work will help future stock assessments as a lead in
to the next paragraph?? How do groundfish stock assessments typcially filter data? **Is that the stevensMacall method??** As a lead in to the next paragraph??)

To explore the changes in data filtering related to structural zeroes, we utilized high resolution fishery sampling and
bathymetry data. We evaluated data from a recreational party boat onboard observer program, which collects location- and species-specific CPUE information from the commercial passenger fishing vessel
(CPFV; also know as party boat) fleet [@Monk:2014:DRD]. The data were collected at the level of a fishing drift and fine-scale habitat data are available for a large fraction of California state
waters. Paired with recently available high-resolution bathymetry data provided an opportunity to overlay each individual fishing drift onto known habitat type (hard vs. soft substrate), and has been
the method utilized for stock assessments since 2015. To explore how data selection methods and the resulting indices would change if the data were only available at a courser resolution, we used the
same data set to develop standardized indices of relative abundance based on three different data filtering methods. We applied these methods across six nearshore rockfish species with different life
histories,habitat preferences and commonness in the data.

The three data treatment methods included filtering the drift-level data based on known location, i.e., the status quo **(what is status quo? StevensMcCall?**), treating the drift-level data as if the
location of the drifts were not available, and lastly, an aggregating of the catches at the drift-level data to a trip. In addition, for the model filtered based on known rocky reef habitat, we
weighted the index by area of habitat within pre-defined regions. For the two cases where we removed the location information, we filtered the data using the Stephens-MacCall method.

The Stephens-MacCall [-@Stephens:2004:MAS] filtering approach was used to predict the probability of encountering the target species, based on the species composition of the catch in a given trip. The
method uses presence/absence data within a logistic regression to identify the probability of encountering a target species given the presence or absence of other predictor species. This method is
commonly used to filter data that were collected dockside after a vessel returned to port or when location data are not provided.

Prior to 2013, these data had not been used to develop an index of abundance for West Coast fisheries stock assessments. That was partially due to the availability of data and at that point in time
not many full stock assessments had been conducted for the nearshore groundfish species. These data were first used without the habitat data in a suite of 2013 data moderate stock assessments
[@Cope:2015:DMS], where data were filtered using positive species observations and an alpha hull method commonly used to estimate species home range sizes and distribution modeles for terrestrial
species [@Burgman:2003:BSR; @Meyer:2017:CHM]

*cut from another place: The onboard observer data provide a high-resolution of catch, effort and the ability to map the fishing drifts to fine-scale habitat data. This paper explores methodological
differences in data treatment to see what we gain by having the high-resolution habitat data and using that as a mechanism to filter out trips that are not targeting the species of interest*

*This paper explores methodological differences in data treatment to determine changes in trends in indices and the associated error among three alternative assumptions and data filtering strategies.
All of the methods described below started with the same subset of drifts from the onboard observer data, restricted to state waters and the years 2004-2016. In the case of application to stock
assessments, all potential data are explored, which may be why trends in indices differ in this paper than what has previously been published in stock assessments. Since the most recent stock
assessments in 2021, the data have undergone a major quality assurance effort by the authors.*

# Methods

\*\*Grammatical tense is not my forte for methods so please advise\*\* *PAST TENSE IS FINE*

*I dropped sentences that were not methods (e.g. details of the FMP). You have an international audience, so avoid details of local management whenever possible.*
We developed indicies of abundance for six species or species pairs of rockfish (*Sebastes spp.*) that are of management interest on the U.S. 
West Coast: black rockfish (*S. melanops*), the blue and deacon rockfish (*S. mystinus*/*S. diaconus*), brown rockfish (*S. auriculatus*), China rockfish (*S.
nebulosus*), gopher rockfish (*S. carnatus*), and the vermilion and sunset rockfish (*S. miniatus*/*S. crocotulus*). The two cryptic species pairs (blue/deacon and sunset/vermilion rockfish) are genetically identifiable, but not separable within the
onboard observer data time series. These six species
all have different latitudinal distributions, exploitation histories, and habitat and depth preferences[@Love:2002:RNP].

## Fishery Survey Data and Habitat-based Filtering
 *fishery data*
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) began a fishery-dependent onboard observer survey of the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV or party/charter boat) fleet in 1999. In 2004,
the survey became part of the CDFW's California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CFRS, *add year and cite website*) that includes additional surveys to quantify catch and effort by the recreational fleet. In response to a request
from the fishing industry, the California Polytechnic State University Institute of Marine Science, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) began a supplemental onboard observer program in 2001 of the CPFV fleet
based in Port Avila and Port San Luis along the Central Coast \[#fig-map\]. Both the CDFW and the Cal Poly onboard observer surveys continue through present day; however, due to both spatial and
temporal recreational regulation changes we limited the dataset for this research to the years 2004 to 2016. Between 1999 and 2003, the recreational regulations evolved from no restriction on the
number of lines or hooks an angler could deploy to a one line and two-hook maximum, as well as implementation of depth restrictions. Subsequent management allowed a relaxation of depth restrictions beginning in 2017, potentially shifting fishing effort relative to the 2004-2016 period [@Monk:2021:SVR]. *(I'd like to discuss implications of this more generally -- not for the paper, but for the upcoming assessments)*

*clarify that "sampler" and "onboard observer" are the same thing*  *Becky here - I would stick to either 'observer' or 'sampler' throughout - unless they are different things - is one terminology perferred over another?*
While only a small portion of the total CPFV trips taken are observed, the onboard observer program collects a large amount of data during each trip. During each at-sea trip the sampler records information
for each fishing drift, defined as a period starting when the captain announced "lines down" to when the captain instructs anglers to reel their lines up. Just prior to the start of each fishing
drift, the sampler selected a subset of anglers to observe, at a maximum of 15 anglers per drift. The sampler records all fish encountered (retained and discarded) by the subset of anglers as a group,
i.e., catch cannot be attributed to an individual angler. Samplers also record the start and end times of a drift, location of the fishing drift (start latitude/longitude and for most drifts, end
latitude/longitude), and minimum and maximum bottom depth. Fish encountered by the group of observed anglers are recorded as either retained or discarded. This provides
information on the catch (count of each species) and effort (time and number of anglers fished) during each fishing drift. While both surveys include records of discarded fish, we only used the
retained catch in these analyses. Discarded fish can often represent a different size structure than retained fish, either due to size limits or angler preference, or represent fish encountered during
a temporal or spatial closure.

The SWFSC developed a relational database for the CDFW onboard survey from 1999-2010[-@Monk:2014:DRD] that has been updated annually. The
Cal Poly data are also provided to the SWFSC annually. All data were checked for potential errors at the drift-level by SWFSC staff.
*based on table below there are trip level data.  Maybe explain what trip vs drift level data is here??*


The drifts included only areas north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$) due to gaps in continous high-resolution habitat coverage further south.
 *MOVE SAMPLE SIZES TO RESULTS: from 2004-2016 contained a total of 19,425 fishing drifts and after removing drifts with missing effort information (time fished or observed anglers),
19,180 drifts remained.* To further remove drifts that may not accurately define a successful fishing drift or represent data errors, the upper and lower 1% of the recorded time fished and recorded
observed anglers were removed. *MOVE TO RESULTS: This resulted in fishing drifts lasting between three and 96 minutes and three to 15 observed anglers, reducing the data to 18,591 fishing drifts.* Given that the fishery
was closed deeper than 40 fathoms for the entire time period from 2004-2016, we filtered the data *MOVE TO RESULTS: to retain 99% of all drifts (18,405 drifts)* based on average drift depth. *MOVE CUTOFF TO RESULTS:, a cutoff of 46.6 fathoms.*
We calculated average depth (OF WHAT? drifts) from the recorded minimum and maximum depths when available from the relational database or the imputed minimum and maximum depth from the bathymetry layer described in the next paragraph. A depth cutoff
slightly deeper than the maximum allowed is reasonable given the rugous habitat fished and all retained drifts occurred within California state waters (up to 3 nm from shore).



*habitat data*
High-resolution seafloor mapping data allowed us to overlay each fishing drift with predicted habitat. We utilized the bathymetry
and backscatter data collected by the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) [\@Golden:2013:CSW]. The CSMP was intiated in 2007 in support of the Marine Life 
Protection Act (citation) to map the underwater habitats and geology of California state waters (mean high water line to 3 nautical miles from shore). 
The data was mapped at a 2 m resolution in 137 continous blocks from north of of Point Conception to the California-Oregon border. Rough and smooth substrates were
identified by CSMP using two rugosity indices, surface:planar area, and vector ruggedness measure (VRM) of the bathymetric digital elevation model. 
The CSMP set a varying VRM threshold for each block, removed any artifacts, and is considered a conservative estimate of rough habitat. 

The 137 CSMP substrate raster blocks were then mosaiced together by authors, and converted the pixels designated as rough habitat (rocky habitat proxy) from a raster
format to polygon, and calculated a 5 m buffer around the rough habitat polygon to allow for any small errors in positional accuracy using ArcMap 10.7 (ESRI citation). 
The area of each reef polygon was calculated, and those reefs greater than or equal to 100 \$m\^2\$ *meters squared is showing up as code in the pdf* were included. 
Contiguous polygons identified as rocky substrate were defined as a singular rocky reef, regardless of size.

Reef polygons were grouped on several different scales.  The finest scale is set to any reef at a distance greater than 200 m apart were defined as separate 
rocky reefs. The 200 m distance criterion was based on a spatial scale meaningful for nearshore rockfish that exhibit high site fidelity, where tagging studies 
have recaptured rockfish close to original capture sites [@Lea:1999:BAM; @Matthews:1985:SSM; @Hannah:2011:SFM; @Hannah:2012:UNC]. Reefs were then grouped together
into 6 latitudinal Mega Reefs (How were these decided?? --maybe we don't need to talk about the fine scale 200m distance reefs as not relevent to this particular
project?? we only use the 'mega reefs' here)  FIGURE 1 STUDY MAP?

The area of rocky habitat for this paper was calculated to exclude portions of the reef that extended outside of California state waters (further than 3 nm from shore).
The mapped area does not include very shallow areas close to shore, which extend approximately 200-500 m from the shoreline. Fishing by the CPFV fleet is limited in 
these waters due to shallow depths and kelp beds.

*Linking high-resolution fishing drifts to high-resolution habitat data*

We assigned fishing drifts
to reefs based on the latitude and longitude of the drift start location. Drift end locations could not be used, because they were 
not always recorded. The distance from the recorded drift start location to the nearest rocky habitat was calculated in meters using the Near analyisis tool in ArcMap.
For each target species, we calculated the cumulative distribution of distance to rocky reef for drifts that retained the target species and used a distance
cutoff of 90% for each species.



*MOVE LAST SENTENCE TO RESULTS: The distance cutoff for blue, China and gopher 
rockfish was six meters, eight meters for vermilion rockfish, 14 meters for black rockfish and 16 meters for brown rockfish.*

## Stephens-MacCall Data Filtering

*MOVE TO INTRODUCTION: It is not often the case where high-resolution habitat and fishing location information are both available, and for many fishery-dependent surveys an analyst will have to determine which subset of the
data to use based on available information. The onboard observer data provide an opportunity to explore what information we gain from explicit knowledge of fishing locations.* To construct a data set that mimics trip-level data, we took the drift-level data and
removed any location identifiers and also aggretated data across drifts within a fishing trip. We then compared results using two levels of aggregation (catch rates by drift and trip) to illustrate the effects on both data filtering and the resulting indices of abundance.

*Include a paragaph in the introduction that briefly summarizes the purpose of the S-M method, i.e. using species composition of the catch to identify effective fishing effort for the target species, and cite it there. That way, you can mention it in the methods and the reader will already be familiar with it.*
Specifically, we applied the Stephens-MacCall method to both the drift-level data and the trip-level data [-@Stephens:2004:MAS]. Prior to any filtering a total of 19,425 drifts that aggregated to 2,270 trips were
available for the analyses. The number of initial samples used for the Stephens-MacCall filtering method were higher than the habitat-informed data described in the previous section because we
retained drifts with missing effort *(do these drifts contribute to catch, but not effort?)* or location data, which allowed us to retain as much information about a trip as possible.

Before applying the Stephens-MacCall method, we identified a suite of potentially informative predictor species for each of the six target species. Species that never co-occurred with the target
species and those present in fewer than 1% of all drifts and 3% of all trips were removed to reduce the number of species to those that were informative. A lower threshold was selected *(say what the lower threshold was)* for the
drift-level data due to the change in magnitude of the number of samples when using drifts vs trips.

The remaining species all co-occurred with the target species in at least one trip and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a
binomial generalized linear model) were positive for species that are more likely to co-occur with the target species, and negative for species that were less likely to be caught with target species.
The intercept represented the probability of observing only the target species in a sample. We also calculated the 95% confidence interval for each coefficient.

Stephens and MacCall [-@Stephens:2004:MAS] proposed filtering (excluding) samples from index standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives and false negatives from
the predicted probability of encounter. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to encounter the target species based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False negatives
(FN) are trips that were not predicted to encounter the target species, given the catch composition, but caught at least one target species. Stephens and MacCall *(don't cite every time)* recommended a threshold where the false negatives and false positives are equally balanced, however, this theshold does not have
any biological relevance and for this particular data set where trained samplers identify all fish. We assumed that if the target species was encountered, the vessel fished in appropriate habitat.

Of interest for the index of abundance was the elimination of trips that had a low probability of catching the target species given the other species caught on the trip. Therefore, we retained all of
the trips that caught the target species and those trips that did not catch the target species, but had a probability higher than the threshold balancing the false negatives and false positives. This
practice has commonly been used in recent stock assessments of rockfish on the West Coast.

#### Indices of Abundance

*Can you use the names for each data set, e.g. "drift-level habitat informed", when you describe the different levels of aggregation and filtering, too?*
Four standardized indices of abundance were generated for each of the six species, one each for the data filtering method (drift-level habitat informed, Stephens-MacCall filtered drift-level,
Stephens-MacCall filtered trip-level) and an area-weighted index from the habitat-informed drift-level data. All indices were modeled using Bayesian generalized linear models (GLMs) and the delta GLM
method [@Lo:1992:IRA]. *(also cite Stefánsson, G. 1996. Analysis of groundfish survey abundance data: combining the GLM and delta approaches. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 53: 577–588.)* The delta GLM method is commonly used to standardize catch-per-unit effort for stock assessments \[citations\]. The delta method models the the data with two separate GLMs; one
for the probability of encountering the species of interest from a binomial likelihood and a logit link function and the second models the positive encounters with either gamma or lognormal error
structure. The error structure of the positive model was selected via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) from models with the full suite of considered explanatory variables.

The response variable for the positive models was angler-retained catch per unit effort. For the indices modeled at the level of a drift, effort was calculated as the number of angler hours fished on
a drift. The trip-level effort was calculated as angler days, using the average number of observed anglers across all drifts on a trip.

To keep comparisons across data filtering methods similar, depth was not considered as an explanatory variable in the habitat-informed index. Depth is often a significant explanatory variable for
rockfish species, with many rockfish species and populations separated by depth [@Love:2002:RNP]. Year was always included in as an explanatory variable in model selection, even if it was not
significant, because the goal of the index of abundance was to extract the year effect. Other explanatory variables considered for the habitat-informed index were the rocky reefs (*describe how reef was included -- categorical (Y/N), or as a distance?)* and wave (a 3-month
aggregated period of time, e.g., January-March). The area-weighted index also included a year/rocky reef interaction term, even if it was not statistically significant, to allow us to weight the index
by the area of rocky reef. The areas of rocky reef were aggregated differently for each species to ensure adequate sample sizes to explore the year/rocky reef interaction.

Explanatory variables for the two indices that were blind to habitat information (Stephens-MacCall filtered drift- and trip-level) included only year, wave and region, i.e., aggregated counties of landing. California has 14 coastal counties north of
Point Conception, 11 of which were represented in these data. We aggregated the northern counties of Del Norte, Humboldt and Mendocino into one region, Sonoma and Marin counties just north of San
Francisco into another region and Alameda and San Francisco counties into a third region. The remaining counties of San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Luis Obispo remained unaggregated.

Model selection for the binomial
and positive observation models was based on AIC using the lme4 package in R, and unless very different predictors were selected, the same predictors were used in each of the two Bayesian models. The Bayesian models
were run with 5,000 iterations and weakly informative priors. Posterior predictive model checks were examined for both the binomial and positive observation models, including the predicted percent positive
compared to the maximum likelihood estimates. We constructed the final year index by multiplying the back-transformed posterior draws from the binomial model with the exponentiation of positive model
draws, and taking the mean and standard deviation for each year.

The area-weighted habitat-informed index was developed by extracting the posterior draws of from each year and area combination of the binomial and positive posterior predictions, and then summing across the product
of the back-transformed posteriors weighted by the fraction of total area within each reef. To compare the indices across the three data filtering methods and the area-weighted index, each index was scaled to its mean
value.

*move this to the discussion*
Versions of the indices filtered based on habitat were approved by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council's Science and Statistical Committee for use in the 2013 stock assessments and have been used
all of the stock assessment process since. Comparisons should not be drawn between the indices presented here and the stock assessment documents as the indices in this paper were simplified to develop
direct comparisons among methods.

# Results

## Survey Data and Habitat Assignment

The data sets were filtered for errors within the relational database before analyses and the data used here reflects changes from the QA/QC process that may not be reflected in data available
directly form CDFW. The addition of the Cal Poly survey to the CDFW survey increased the sample sizes of observed trips out of San Luis Obispo county by an average of 155% from 2004-2016.

Approximately 21% of the CDFW observed groundfish trips were north of Point Conception, which is xxx to the xxx% of estimated charter boat effort across the state \[pull and cite RecFIN\]. North of
Bodega Bay, California the majority of charter boats are smaller 6-pack vessel that may not have the capacity to carry an observer onboard.

We defined 108 areas of rocky habitat on the finest scale within California state waters from Point Conception to the California/Oregon border. After exploratory analyses and considering the the
availability of data, the areas rocky habitat was grouped into six regions to ensure adequate sample sizes for developing indices of abundance (Figure \@fig-map). While covering a small area, the
number of available samples from the Farallon Islands off the coast of San Francisco was high enough to warrant keeping it as a separate area of rocky habitat. The region defined from the
California/Oregon to San Francisco encompasses 49% of the total rocky habitat in state waters by area, but only 12% of the observed drifts fished in this area, and represents approximately 9% of the
total effort. Each of the four remaining nearshore regions from San Francisco to Point Conception contained an average of 11% of the available habitat.

Bay: 38% effort

Central: 53%

Redwood: 4%

Wine: 5%

The CDFW manages recreational fisheries by counties aggregated to districts, four of which are north of Point Conception. The

The distribution of the speci

, i.e., black rockfish has a more northerly distribution reflected in the aggregation of data from Santa Cruz and south, whereas brown rockfish is distributed across coastal California (Figure xxx).

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of more than one species or species complex
("mixed trips") can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat associations informative for an index of abundance.

A look at the distirbution of each species by the percent of positive observations (over all years) and the average CPUE at the drift-level by aggregated areas of rocky habitat are presented in Figure
xxx.

Look at which of the same drift were selected in the two methods!

**Map figures BECKY. this was the drift level filtered data. Melissa double check** Percent postive catch generally showed higher catches south of San Francisco
for vermillion, gopher, brown, and blue rockfishes (FIGURE XX).  Black rockish showed higher postive catches in the north, while China rockfish had a low postive catch 
rate coastwide. CPUE catches (FIGURE XX) were highest for blue rockish between San Francisco south to Big Sur (interesting because this area is where we saw the changeover
from predomanatly blue to deacon). Black rockfish CPUE catches were higher in the north, while gopher rockfish CPUE was generally consistent throught the coast,
albiet slightly higher south of Big Sur. China rockfish CPUE catch was typically low coastwide, with slightly higher catch rates in the Farallon Island reefs. 


## Stephens-MacCall Data Filtering

Species that never co-occurred with the target species and species present in less than 3% of all from 2004-2016 contained

9,425 drifts that aggregated to 2,252 trips that retained at least only trips were excluded from the

Trip level data resulted in xxxx trips

The percent of the samples retained for each data method differed by species, but followed the general trend that the lowest percent of samples were retained from the Stephens-MacCall filtering at the
drift level, ranging from 12% of samples retained for China rockfish and 54% for blue rockfish. A much higher percent of samples were retained both from the other two methods, with an average of 83%
of drifts retained when habitat was included as a filter. The species retained for the trip-level and drift-level Stephens-MacCall filtering were similar across species

For the drift level data, the Stephens-MacCall data does retain drifts off the reefs

Data filtering for the indices with data aggregated to the trip-level and using the status quo of retaining all positive observations resulted in a high proportion of positive samples (0.70 - 0.86)
for all species.

# Discussion

The majority of groundfish species targeted by the CPFV fleet north of Point Conception during the time period of this study all have high associations to rocky habitat. In this case, the
Stephens-MacCall method can be considered a proxy for habitat when the species of interest has known associations

spatio-temporal modelling

Gopher rockfish was assessed as part of a species complex with black-and-yellow rockfish (*Sebastes chrysomelus*) in 2019, but were visually identifiable and the data in this paper represents only
gopher rockfish [@Monk:2019:CSG].

*The influence of an index of abundance is sometime the can have a large influence on end year estimation of stock status (find examples).*

When filtering and modelling data for a stock assessment, additional filtering steps would be taken, such as excluding areas where species are rare, e.e., south of Santa Cruz for black rockfish.
However, this is also a function of the lower sampling rates along the coast north of San Francisco.

These models also do not account for distance to the nearest port, which has been shown to significantly impact the access to fish as well as historical fishing pressure....In addition, in 2004 the
CDFW implements spatial and temporal closures to the recreational nearshore groundfish fishery. There are currently XX management areas and recreational fishing is restricted shoreward of 20 fathoms
in the northern regions of the state to a deep as 40 fathoms in areas north of Point Conception.

The CRFS onboard observer program prioritizes trips with groundfish target species. There is not a mixed fishery in California north of Point Conception. The main bottom fish target is sanddabs

The recreational fishery in southern California is more of a mixed fishery and a trip is often not purely groundfish.

An absolute index is oftentimes input as a single year due to the high cost associated with determining total fish abundance within an area [@Love:2009:DFA].

This is one

Retained catch for a given recreational is dependent on a number of factors including weather, distance from port, the clientele preferences, angler experience and captain's knowledge.

The high proportion of retained drifts across species when using habitat as a data filter indicates that hate majority of drifts occurred over, or very close to, rocky habitat.

Oftentimes a captain will position the vessel adjacent to rocky habitat so that the current allows the vessel to drift over the rocky habitat.

The fishery-dependent indices of abundance undergo higher levels of scrutiny during stock assessment reviews due to the nature of the data being driven by fisher behavior. The one fishery-independent
survey for nearshore groundfish in California north of California tends to have similar trends to the fishery-dependent indices for the shallower nearshore species like gopher and China rockfish.

Both blue and black rockfish have high affinity to rocky habitat, but occur higher off the bottom and are both schooling species. It is not uncommon to have a a drift dominated by blue rockfish.

However, the Stephen-MacCall approach does not account for this by modeling presence/absence.

The choice of a threshold value to use as a data filter from the Stephen-MacCall method should be reviewed to determine how sensitive an index of abundance is to that method. The

Recent studies have identified the need to investigate the assumptions and uncertainty in relative indices of abundance from visual surveys [@Bacheler:2015:ERA; @Campbell:2015:CRA] and simulation
studies [@Siegfried:2016:ISA].

Prioritize data for stock assessments [@Magnusson:2007:WMF].

Stock synthesis weighting of indices based on CVs - is the CV tighter for the fishery-independent survey to give it have an edge over the onboard observer survey?

CDFW sampler manual - "10 anglers should be the target number of observed anglers"

encompass the entire range of the species. However, the point of the exercise is to compare the two methods and these surveys are sampling the same habitats in the SCB

accepted for management (China, gopher/black-and-yellow, vermilion/sunset, blue/deacon, black, lingcod - cite assessments).

The characteristics and classification of the rocky habitat are not yet avaialble and this results all rock types treated as equ

Survey indices can be either absolute or relative. In the case of an absolute index of abundance, the entire population within the sampling area is accounted for and the index also provides
information on the density of the fish species within that area as well as aid in scaling the population size within the stock assessment model. Most indices of abundance are relative due to the fact
that the entire population within the survey area was not observed. Estimates of absolute abundance are difficult to obtain, especially for cryptic rockfishes. The cowcod (*Sebastes levis*) stock
assessments is one of the only West Coast stock assessments that has incorporated an estimate of absolute abundance, derived from a visual survey [@Love:2009:DFA] add assessment. The majority of stock
assessments include one or more index of relative abundance.

Data were limited to the California coast north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$). The composition of the fish communities in southern California differ, and the recreational fisheries are
fundamentally different, with a higher percentage of trips targeting mixed species and pelagic and highly migratory species, as well as more limited access to rocky habitat nearshore. Point Conception
is a biogeographic break (citation) and a number of stock assessments In addition, complete habitat data are not available for areas in southern California. The data were also temporally restricted to
the years 2001-2016. Earlier and more recent data were excluded to preserve a dataset with the most consistent gear and depth regulations.

Composition data from recreational surveys had the largest impact on simulation results, but individual survey components did not have individual effects on benchmarks [@Siegfried:2016:ISA].\

The onboard observer surveys decrease the amount of uncertainty, but relative to a fishery-independent survey, is still high....

A key assumption of the onboard observer programs is that fishing behavior remains the same when observers are not onboard the vessel. If a captain only fishes particular locations or targets a
different suite of species when an observer is onboard the vessel, additional bias is introduced in the data
