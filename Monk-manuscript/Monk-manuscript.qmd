# Introduction

Integrated fisheries stock assessment models utilize a variety of data sources to develop the most
complete picture of the stock and current status in relation to management thresholds. Catch data is
a primary input to stock assessments and informs the overall magnitude of the stock. Catch data are
often input with the assumption that the removals are known with absolute precision, i.e., there is
no error associated with removals. Fisheries survey and catch data are used to develop standardized
indices of abundance that inform fisheries stock assessment models [@Maunder:2004:SCE]. A
standardized index of abundance informs the model on the size of the population during a particular
year or years, either as an absolute value or a relative value. An absolute index of abundance is an
estimate of the true density of fish in a particular area and is most commonly estimated from visual
survey data. An absolute index is oftentimes input as a single year due to the high cost associated
with determining total fish abundance within an area [@Love:2009:DFA].

More often, an index of abundance is a relative measure of the population and requires a time series
to inform the stock assessment model. An index of relative abundance assumes that changes in the
index are proportional to changes of abundance in the population [@Harley:2001:CUE].
Fishery-independent data collected from standardized survey designs provide a more unbiased
estimation of the trend in a fisheries population. However, fishery-independent surveys are costly,
labor intensive and often require a long time series to be considered informative in fisheries stock
assessments. When fishery-independent data are not available, stock assessment scientists make use
of the best available data, which may often only include fishery-dependent data.

Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is a common metric available from fisheries and collected on surveys.
Depending on the stock assessment model and the available data for a particular fish stock, an index
of stock status can have a large influence on end year estimation of stock status (find examples).

There are both advantages and disadvantages that must be considered when using to fishery-dependent
data. Fishery-dependent data are collected directly from the the fishery and are less costly than
the whose operations are not constrained by sampling designs, but dependent on the behaviors of the
captain and vessel and, in the case of recreational trips, customer preference.

Fishery-dependent data are only collected from areas legally open areas can be collected, i.e.,
areas closed to fishing are not sampled. In California, this includes a network of marine protected
areas (MPAs), rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) developed based on depth closures, and varying
seasonal and depth closures that vary temporally and spatially along California's coastline.
Fishery-independent surveys are conducted using a scientific study design and, depending on the
study, are not always confined to the same regulations as the commercial and recreational fishing
sectors. In an ideal situation, both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent surveys would used to
inform the stock assessment model.

Fishery-dependent surveys sample the fishing fleets and are subject to potential sampling biases.
The sampling is dependent on the fishing boat's behavior, which is to maximize catch. Sampling of
the fishing fleet is often opportunistic based on the availability of samplers and the availability
of trips to sample. Sampling the fisheries can also be constrained to the current regulations, which
may prohibit the retention of a species or fishing at certain depths, i.e., California Department of
Fish and Wildlife has varying spatial and temporal depth and season closures implemented through six
management regions. There is also a fairly new network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) designated
from 2007-2012 that prohibit recreational fishing, and are therefore areas no longer sampled by the
recreational fishing fleet. However, the advantage to fishery-dependent sampling the reduced program
cost compared to a more intensive fishery-independent survey.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council manages groundfish off the West Coast of the United States
under the Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The FMP includes 64 species of rockfish, \_\_\_
of which do not have full stock assessments. Many of these species, especially those nearshore, are
assessed using multiple assessment models to represent areas with distinct fishing histories,
communities regulations. Along the U.S. West Coast, even if the stock assessment is categorized as
data rich, oftentimes the only index of abundance available is from a fishery-dependent CPUE time
series of observed recreational angler catch rates [@Cope:2013:ISC].

A common characteristic of ecological data is a high proportion of zero observations across samples
and the question as to whether the sampling occurred within the species' habitat and the species was
not observed or if the sampling occurred outside of the species' habitat (structural zeroes).
Fisheries survey data are often subset to exclude structural zeroes using the Stephens-MacCall
method [-@Stephens:2004:MAS], which models the probability of observing the target species given the
other the presence/absence of other species. However, the onboard observer survey collected
location-specific information on each observer fish encounter. To subset the onboard observer survey
data and exclude structural zeroes, we used the positive catch locations as a proxy for suitable
habitat.

We evaluated data from a recreational onboard observer program, which collects location- and
species-specific CPUE information from the commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV; also know as
party boat) fleet [@Monk:2014:DRD]. The data are collected at the level of a fishing drift and
fine-scale habitat data are available for a large fraction of California state waters. To determine
the impact and effect of developing indices with data from known fishing locations mapped to rocky
reef habitat to indices without known habitat information, we used the same data set to develop
standardized indices of relative abundance based on three different data filtering methods. The
three data treatment methods included an aggregation of the catches at the drift-level data to a
trip, treating the drift-level data as if specific locations were not available, and lastly
filtering the drift-level data based on known locations. In addition, for the model filtered based
on known rocky reef substrate, we weighted the index by area of habitat within pre-defined regions.

*cut from another place: The onboard observer data provide a high-resolution of catch, effort and
the ability to map the fishing drifts to fine-scale habitat data. This paper explores methodological
differences in data treatment to see what we gain by having the high-resolution habitat data and
using that as a mechanism to filter out trips that are not targeting the species of interest*

*This paper explores methodological differences in data treatment to determine changes in trends in
indices and the associated error among three alternative assumptions and data filtering strategies.
All of the methods described below started with the same subset of drifts from the onboard observer
data, restricted to state waters and the years 2004-2016. In the case of application to stock
assessments, all potential data are explored, which may be why trends in indices differ in this
paper than what has previously been published in stock assessments. Since the most recent stock
assessments in 2021, the data have undergone a major quality assurance effort by the authors.*

# Methods

## Survey Data

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) began a fishery-dependent onboard observer
survey of the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV or party/charter boat) fleet in 1999. In
2004, the survey became part of the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CFRS) that includes
additional surveys to quantify the catches and effort of the recreational fleet. Sampling effort for
groundfish-targeted CPFV trips was distributed in proportion to fishing effort, and approximately
21% of the CDFW observed groundfish trips were north of Point Conception. North of Bodega Bay,
California the majority of charter boats are smaller 6-pack vessel that may not have the capacity to
carry an observer onboard. In 2001, the California Polytechnic State University Institute of Marine
Science, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) began a supplemental onboard observer program of the CPFV fleet
based in Port Avila and Port San Luis along the Central Coast. Protocols for the Cal Poly survey
were the same as the CDFW survey, with the exception that Cal Poly measured retained and discarded
fish from observed anglers. The additional of the Cal Poly data to the CDFW survey increases the
sample sizes of observed trips out of San Luis Obispo county by an average of 58% since 2004.

On a trip, observers recorded information for each drift, each time lines were in the water. Just
prior to the start of each fishing drift, the sampler selected a subset of anglers to observe, at
maximum of 10-15 anglers per drift. The sampler recorded all fish encountered (retained and
discarded) by the subset of anglers as a group. Samplers also recorded the time fished (starting
when the captain announced "Lines down" to when the captain instructed anglers to reel lines up),
coordinates of the fishing drift (start latitude/longitude and/or end latitude/longitude), and
minimum and maximum bottom depth. Fish encountered by the group of observed anglers were recorded to
the species level as either retained or discarded, providing a count of each species at a particular
location. For these analyses we modeled only the retained catch. The catch and fishing time of an
individual angler were not recorded. Additional details can be found in Monk et al.
[-@Monk:2014:DRD].

We explored the methods described in the following sections to develop indices of abundance for six
species or species complexes of management interest: black rockfish (*Sebastes melanops*), blue and
deacon rockfish complex (*Sebastes mystinus*, *Sebastes diaconus*), brown rockfish (*Sebastes
auriculatus*), China rockfish (*Sebastes nebulosus*), gopher rockfish (*Sebastes carnatus*), and
vermilion and sunset rockfish complex (*Sebastes miniatus*/*Sebastes crocotulus*). Two genetically
distinct species compose a cryptic species pair that are often visually indistinguishable, or for
other reasons, were not recorded separately in surveys or catch histories. Gopher rockfish was
assessed as part of a species complex with black-and-yellow rockfish (*Sebastes chrysomelus*) in
2019, but were visually identifiable and the data in this paper represents only gopher rockfish
[@Monk:2019:CSG].

#### Stephens-MacCall Data Filtering

We used the Stephens-MacCall approach to filter data for the trip-level data and also the
drift-level data assuming no location information. To create a trip from the drift-level data, we
aggregated the retained fish catches within a trip. The trip-level effort was calculated as angler
days, using the average number of observed anglers across all drifts on a trip. The trip-level index
used all available data before any filtering was done to exclude individual drifts with missing
effort or location data.

The second filtering approach retained data a the drift-level, but assumed no knowledge of the
fishing location, besides the port of landing and the data were filtered using the Stephens-MacCall
approach.

The Stephens-MacCall [-@Stephens:2004:MAS] filtering approach was used to predict the probability of
encountering the target species, based on the species composition of the catch in a given trip. The
method uses presence/absence data within a logistic regression to identify the probability of
encountering a target species given the presence or absence of other predictor species. This method
is commonly used to filter data that are collected dockside after a vessel returns to port. Prior to
applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative predictor species, i.e.,
species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage (present in at least 5% of all trips) to
inform the binomial model. The remaining species all co-occurred with the target species in at least
one trip and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients from the
Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive for species that are more likely to co-occur
with the target species, and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with target
species.

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species assuming all effort
was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of more than one species or species complex
("mixed trips") can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in
terms of habitat associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall
[-@Stephens:2004:MAS] recommended including all trips above a threshold where the false negatives
and false positives are equally balanced. However, this does not have any biological relevance and
for this particular data set where trained observers identify all fish. We assumed that if the
target species was encountered, the vessel fished in appropriate habitat. Stephens and MacCall
[-@Stephens:2004:MAS] proposed filtering (excluding) samples from index standardization based on a
criterion of balancing the number of false positives and false negatives from the predicted
probability of encounter. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to encounter the target
species based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False negatives (FN) are trips
that were not predicted to encounter the target species, given the catch composition, but caught at
least one target species.

Of interest for the index of abundance is the elimination of trips that had a low probability of
catching the target species given the other species caught on the trip. Therefore, we retained all
of the trips that caught the target species and those trips that did not catch the target species,
but had a probability higher than the threshold balancing the false negatives and false positives.
This practice has commonly been used in recent stock assessments of rockfish on the West Coast.

The full data from 2004-2016 contained 2,252 trips that retained at least one fish. Species that
never co-occurred with the target species and species present in fewer than 3% of all trips were
excluded from the Stephens-MacCall analysis.

For the drift-level data that assumed no knowledge of habitat information, the Stephens-MacCall
filter was applied with each individual drift as a sample. Species that never co-occurred with the
target species and those present in fewer than 1% of all drifts were removed to reduce the number of
species to those that were informative.

#### Habitat-informed Data Filtering

This paper limited the data to observations within California state waters north of Point Conception
($34^\circ 27^\prime N$), which were mapped at a resolution of 2 m by the California Seafloor
Mapping Program (CSMP). Rough and smooth substrate was identified by CSMP using two rugosity indices
based upon bathymetric data, surface:planar area, and vector ruggedness measure (VRM). We considered
areas identified as 'rough' as reef habitat. Individual reefs at the finest scale were defined as
raster cells of rough habitat greater than 200 m apart. The distance was chosen based on evidence
that a number of nearshore rockfish exhibit site fidelity and a number of tagging studies have
recaptured close to original capture sites [@Lea:1999:BAM; @Matthews:1985:SSM; @Hannah:2011:SF;
@Hannah:2012:UNC]. Contiguous raster cells classified as hard substrate remained as a singular reef,
regardless of size. Reefs were further defined with a 5 m buffer to account for potential error in
positional accuracy. The area of a reef was calculated to exclude portions of the reef that extended
outside of California state waters (further than 3 nm from shore). The mapped area does not include
the white zones close to shore.

Individual fishing drifts were assigned to reefs based on the recorded start location, given that
the drift end locations were not always recorded. The data contained a total of 19,425 fishing
drifts and after removing drifts with missing effort information (time fished or observed anglers),
19,180 remained. To further remove drifts that may not accurately define a successful fishing drift
or data errors, the upper and lower 1% of the recorded fish time and observed anglers were removed.
This resulted in fishing drifts lasting between three and 96 minutes fished with three to 15
observed anglers, reducing the data to 18,591 fishing drifts.

For indices incorporating habitat information, we filtered the data on depth to retain 99% of
drifts, which resulted in a depth cutoff of 46.6 fathoms and retained 18,405 drifts. We did not use
depth as a predictor in the indices. The fishery was closed deeper than 40 fathoms for the entire
time period from 2004-2016, and the additional 6 fathoms is within the scope of error given the
rugous bottom habitat.

The distance from rocky reef composed the last filter for indices including habitat. Using the
drifts with the target species, we retained 90% of drift from the cumulative frequency of distance
to rocky habitat. The cutoff for blue, China and gopher rockfish was six meters, eight meters for
vermilion rockfish, 14 meters for black rockfish and 16 meters for brown rockfish.

#### Indices of Abundance

Standardized indices of abundance were generated for each data filtering method and an area-weighted
index was developed from the drift-level habitat data. All indices were modeled using Bayesian
generalized linear models (GLMs) and the delta method [@Lo:1992:IRA]. The delta method models the
data with two separate GLMs; one for the probability of encountering the species of interest from a
binomial likelihood and a logit link function and the second GLM models the positive encounters with
either gamma or lognormal error structure.

The response variable for the positive models was catch per unit effort. Covariates for the
trip-level data and drift-level data without habitat included 3-month wave and county of landing.
Covariates considered for the drift-level data with habitat filters included, aggregated reef area
and wave (3-month aggregated periods of time). Each drift-level index with habitat information was
also run to include a year/reef iteration and weighted based on reef area.

Year was always included in the trip-level data were 3-month wave and county of landing. Covariates
considered for the drift-level data included, aggregated reef area, 3-month wave, and xxxx.

The gamma or lognormal error distribution was chosen via maximum likelihood AIC from the full model
with all covariates. Model selection for the binomial and positive observation models were also
selected using AIC and unless very different predictors were selected, the same predictors were used
in each of the two Bayesian models. The Bayesian models were run with 5,000 iterations and
uninformative priors. Posterior predictive model checks were examined for both the binomial and
positive observation models. including xxxxxxx. We constructed the final year index by multiplying
the back-transformed posterior draws from the binomial model with the exponentiated positive model
draws, and taking the mean and standard deviation for each year.

The area-weighted index was developed by extracting the posterior draws of from each year and area
combination of the binomial and positive posterior predictions, and then summing across the product
of the posteriors weighted by the fraction of total area within each reef.

To better compare the resulting indices across the three data filtering methods and the
area-weighted index, each index was scaled to its mean.

Versions of the indices filtered based on habitat were approved by the Pacific Fisheries Management
Council's Science and Statistical Committee for use in the 2013 stock assessments and have been used
all of the stock assessment process since. Comparisons should not be drawn between the indices
presented here and the stock assessment documents as the indices in this paper were simplified to
develop direct comparison among methods.

# Discussion

Lots to discuss!

Recent studies have identified the need to investigate the assumptions and uncertainty in relative
indices of abundance from visual surveys [@Bacheler:2015:ERA; @Campbell:2015:CRA] and simulation
studies [@Siegfried:2016:ISA].

Prioritize data for stock assessments [@Magnusson:2007:WMF].

Stock synthesis weighting of indices based on CVs - is the CV tighter for the fishery-independent
survey to give it have an edge over the onboard observer survey?

CDFW sampler manual - "10 anglers should be the target number of observed anglers"

encompass the entire range of the species. However, the point of the exercise is to compare the two
methods and these surveys are sampling the same habitats in the SCB

accepted for management (China, gopher/black-and-yellow, vermilion/sunset, blue/deacon, black,
lingcod - cite assessments).

Survey indices can be either absolute or relative. In the case of an absolute index of abundance,
the entire population within the sampling area is accounted for and the index also provides
information on the density of the fish species within that area as well as aid in scaling the
population size within the stock assessment model. Most indices of abundance are relative due to the
fact that the entire population within the survey area was not observed. Estimates of absolute
abundance are difficult to obtain, especially for cryptic rockfishes. The cowcod (*Sebastes levis*)
stock assessments is one of the only West Coast stock assessments that has incorporated an estimate
of absolute abundance, derived from a visual survey [@Love:2009:DFA] add assessment. The majority of
stock assessments include one or more index of relative abundance.

Data were limited to the California coast north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$). The
composition of the fish communities in southern California differ, and the recreational fisheries
are fundamentally different, with a higher percentage of trips targeting mixed species and pelagic
and highly migratory species, as well as more limited access to rocky habitat nearshore. Point
Conception is a biogeographic break (citation) and a number of stock assessments In addition,
complete habitat data are not available for areas in southern California. The data were also
temporally restricted to the years 2001-2016. Earlier and more recent data were excluded to preserve
a dataset with the most consistent gear and depth regulations.

Composition data from recreational surveys had the largest impact on simulation results, but
individual survey components did not have individual effects on benchmarks [@Siegfried:2016:ISA].\
The onboard observer surveys decrease the amount of uncertainty, but relative to a
fishery-independent survey, is still high....

A key assumption of the onboard observer programs is that fishing behavior remains the same when
observers are not onboard the vessel. If a captain only fishes particular locations or targets a
different suite of species when an observer is onboard the vessel, additional bias is introduced in
the data
